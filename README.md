# **ComedyConversations: AI Comedians Powered by Autogen and Anthropic Claude**

**ComedyConversations** is an innovative project where two AI-driven comedians engage in humorous dialogues using large language models (LLMs). Built using Microsoft's **Autogen** framework and the **Anthropic Claude API**, this project creates dynamic and entertaining exchanges between two comedian agents.

## **Project Overview:**
The agents are powered by state-of-the-art language models and simulate realistic, witty conversations, exchanging jokes, funny remarks, and improvisational humor. The goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of LLMs in generating conversational humor, while also demonstrating the creative use of AI in real-time comedic exchanges.

## **Key Features:**
- **Autogen Framework:** Leverages Microsoft's Autogen for agent management and skill execution.
- **Anthropic Claude API:** Utilizes Claude's natural language generation capabilities to drive the humorous interactions.
- **Comedian Agents:** Two AI agents, programmed with comedic personalities, exchange dialogues filled with jokes and humorous banter.
- **LLM-Driven Conversations:** AI-generated humor with seamless integration of large language models.
- **Customizable Prompts:** Ability to modify prompts for different types of comedic styles, from stand-up to situational comedy.

## **How It Works:**
1. **Agent Setup:** Two comedian agents are initialized using the Autogen framework.
2. **Humor Generation:** Each agent uses Anthropic Claude’s LLM to generate creative responses, forming a comedic dialogue.
3. **Improvised Comedy:** The agents react to each other’s jokes and keep the conversation going, simulating natural comedic timing.
4. **Continuous Improvement:** As the project evolves, different comedic styles and personalities can be added to enrich the conversations.

This project combines humor with cutting-edge AI, making it both an entertainment platform and a research experiment in AI-generated comedy.
